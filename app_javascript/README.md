## Installation

To run this Node.js web application on your local machine, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Q-Tify/core-course-labs-devops.git

# Change to the project directory
cd core-course-labs-devops
cd app_javascript

# Install Dependencies:
npm install

# Start the Application:
node app.js

# Access the Application
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the Random Quote Generator.

```

## Usage
Upon accessing the application in your web browser, you will see a "Get New Quote" button. Clicking this button will display a random quote on the page.

## Features
- Displays random quotes to users.
- User-friendly web interface.
- No database required, quotes are selected from a predefined list.
- Simple and responsive design for various devices.
- Provides users with inspirational and thought-provoking content.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: The core runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle HTTP requests and routes.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend design and structure using HTML and CSS.
- JavaScript: Used for client-side interactivity and fetching random quotes from the server.
- Docker: Containerization technology used to package and deploy the application in a consistent and isolated environment, ensuring portability and ease of deployment across various platforms and environments.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- public/: Directory for static assets (HTML, CSS, JS).
- css/: Directory for CSS stylesheets.
- style.css: Stylesheet for the web application.
- index.html: The HTML template for the web page.
- js/: Directory for client-side JavaScript.
- main.js: Handles client-side interactions and fetches quotes.
- app.js: The main Node.js application file that sets up the Express.js server.
- tests/: Directory for tests.
- README.md: Project documentation file.
- JAVASCRIPT.md: Best practices documentation file.
- LICENSE: The license information for this project.
- .dockerignore: File specifying which files and directories should be ignored when creating a Docker image, ensuring only necessary files are included.
- Dockerfile: The Dockerfile that defines how the Docker image for the application should be built.
- Docker.md: Documentation file providing instructions and best practices for using Docker in the project.

# Docker section
This project includes a Dockerfile that allows you to containerize the Node.

## This particular case
```
git clone https://github.com/Q-Tify/core-course-labs-devops/tree/lab2
cd app_javascript
docker build -t arseniy5443/randomquote:latest .
docker run -p 80:3000 --rm arseniy5443/randomquote:latest

docker login
docker push arseniy5443/randomquote:latest

docker pull arseniy5443/randomquote
```

## How to build docker image?
```
docker build -t [image name]:[image tag] [path to dockerfile]
```

## How to run docker container?
```
docker run -p [local port]:[docker port] --rm [image name]:[image tag]

docker run -d -p [local port]:[docker port] --rm --name [container name] [image name]:[image tag]

docker start [container name]
docker stop [container name]
```

Possible to add ENV:
```
docker run -p [local port]:[docker port] -e PORT=80 [image name]:[image tag]
```
Or to take it from file, create dir config and there .env file, put there all variables and use command:
```
docker run -p [local port]:[docker port] --env-file ./config/.env [image name]:[image tag]
```

## How to upload to docker hub?

```
docker login
```
It is important that the name of the image should contain docker username + / + image name:
```
docker push [docker username]/[image name]:[image tag]
```

To rename image:
```
docker tag [old image] [docker username]/[new image]
```

## How to download image from docker hub?
```
docker pull [image name]
```

<br><br>

## How to delete all stopped containers?
```
docker container prune
```

## How to delete all images?
```
docker image prune -a
```

## How to see all containers?
```
docker ps -a
```

## How to see all images?
```
docker images
```

## How to delete:
- all stopped containers
- all networks not used by at least one container
- all dangling images
- all dangling build cache
```
docker system prune
```

# Unit Tests
To run the tests for this application you can use precommit, with linting (changes should be staged) the app will be tested:
```
npm run precommit
```
Or you can run test separately with command:
```
npm run test
```

# CI Workflow

### Overview

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) to automate various tasks such as code linting, testing, vulnerability scanning, and Docker image building. The CI workflow ensures code quality, security, and smooth deployments.

### Workflow Details

The CI workflow is defined in the [.github/workflows/javascript-ci.yml](.github/workflows/javascript-ci.yml) file. It is triggered automatically on every push or pull to the `app_javascript` directory or changes to the workflow file itself.

Here's what the workflow does:

1. **JavaScript Build Job**:
   - Runs on Ubuntu-Latest.
   - Tests the project with Node.js versions 14 and 16.
   - Checks out the code from the repository.
   - Sets up Node.js with the specified versions and caches npm dependencies.
   - Displays the Node.js version.
   - Installs Node.js dependencies.
   - Lints the JavaScript code using ESLint and fixes issues.
   - Runs JavaScript tests.

2. **Snyk Security Scan**:
   - Ensures security by checking for vulnerabilities in our project's dependencies.
   - Uses Snyk to perform security scans on our JavaScript codebase.
   - The results are uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning for review.

3. **Docker Build & Push Job**:
   - Runs on Ubuntu-Latest and depends on the JavaScript Build and Snyk Security Scan jobs.
   - Logs in to Docker Hub using Docker secrets.
   - Sets up Docker Buildx for efficient multi-platform image building.
   - Builds and pushes a Docker image based on the `Dockerfile` in the `app_javascript` directory. The image is tagged as `latest`.
