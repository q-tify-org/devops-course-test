### CI Best Practices

In this document, I'll outline the best practices applied in our CI (Continuous Integration) workflow for my Python project. These practices are designed to improve efficiency, maintain code quality, and enhance the overall development process.

### Best practices:
1. **Parallelization:**
   - I parallelized snyk-security and python-build in my project. This practice allows me to take advantage of my CI provider's capabilities to run multiple tests at the same time, making my workflow faster.

2. **Caching:**
    - I implemented caching for python and other dependencies. Caching helps optimize builds by reusing previously built dependencies, which reduces the need for time-consuming installations.

3. **Matrix Builds:**
    - I am using matrix builds to test my application across different Python versions. This practice ensures that our application remains compatible with various Python environments and configurations.

4. **Clean Up Resources:**
    - Cleaning up resources prevents resource leaks and maintains a clean development environment.

5. **Security Scans with Snyk:**
    - I integrated security scanning tool into my workflow to identify vulnerabilities. This practice enhances the security of my codebase by identifying potential security risks.

6. **Documentation:**
    - I documented my CI workflow for contributors in README.md. Documentation provides transparency on how to trigger the workflow, what each job does, and where to find logs and reports.

7. **Regular Review:**
    - I periodically review and optimize our CI workflow. Regular review ensures that my CI workflow stays aligned with evolving technologies and best practices.

8. **Use of CI Variables:**
    - I utilize Continuous Integration (CI) environment variables effectively within my workflows to securely store and access sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, or secrets. This best practice ensures that sensitive data is not hard-coded in my workflow files, enhancing security and maintainability.

9. **Naming of steps and jobs:**
    - I provide clear and informative descriptions for each step and job in my CI workflows. Well-documented steps and jobs make it easier for contributors and team members to understand the purpose and execution of each task within the workflow, promoting collaboration and transparency.

10. **Use of dependent jobs:**
    - I implement dependent jobs within my CI workflows to define a clear sequence of tasks that must be executed in a specific order. This ensures that critical tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying, are executed sequentially, and dependent jobs are triggered only if their predecessors succeed. This best practice helps maintain a structured and efficient workflow, reducing errors and optimizing resource usage.
